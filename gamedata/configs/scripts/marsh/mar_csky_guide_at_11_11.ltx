; DC280117: Made it so the member of a squad in 'attack' mode cannot be the guide at the Southern Farmstead.
;           This should prevent the faction war stalling due to the guide role there being assigned to a
;           member of a squad that the game thinks is moving to an assigned faction war target smart terrain
;           (e.g. Machine Yard) but cannot do so because the guide is bottlenecking its movement.
