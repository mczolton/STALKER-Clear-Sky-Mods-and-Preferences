STALKER FOV SWITCHER v1.4


What's new in v1.4:
Clear Sky v1.5.10 support added. But only for versions patched with nodvd.
The expanded menu of FOV choice (67.50, 75, 83, 85, 90) is added for all versions.

What's new in v1.3:
Clear Sky v1.5.04 - 1.5.07 support added. But only for versions patched with RELOADED nodvd.
You may find nodvd at http://gamecopyworld.com
The [EFIGS] nodvd v1.5.07 also is suitable for russian version of the game.

Description:
This program switches FOV (field of view) by changing xrgame.dll to the corrected one.
With expanded FOV (Field of View) appears the sense of dynamics at movement, other perception of surrounding, the world seems more volumetric.

It is intended for:
STALKER SHADOW OF CHERNOBYL v1.0003-v1.0006
STALKER build 3120
STALKER CLEAR SKY v1.5.04-1.5.07 (only versions with nodvd installed)
STALKER CLEAR SKY v1.5.10 (only versions with nodvd installed)

Installation:
Copy it to the game folder.
BACKUP your original xrgame.dll somewhere. In the case of problems just copy it back.
Run fov_switch.cmd
In the opened window enter the number from 1 till 40 depending on your game version and chosen FOV.

I do not recommend to create a server/clients in Shadow of Chernobyl by the Internet, using changed xrgame.dll.
It will not be possible to connect. Or it will be necessary to agree in advance that on all computers in a network would be the same xrgame.dll.
But in Clear Sky it's possible to connect by internet with the machines which have not this patch.

Do not forget that either Shadow of Chernobyl or Clear Sky supports external camera modes by F1-F3.
Plus and minus buttons on the right of keyboard are used to zoom.
Also you may use F4 in mp to switch into free-fly mode, when you are offline.
To enable it you should use the console and enter four commands:

bind cam_1 kF1
bind cam_2 kF2
bind cam_3 kF3
bind cam_4 kF4
